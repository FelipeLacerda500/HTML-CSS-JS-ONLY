# Spa Application

This small web application serves as a learning and practice ground for honing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The primary focus of each language in this project is outlined below:

HTML:

Use of semantic HTML elements, together with the utilization of an element identified as "app," whose content is dynamically changed according to the route or page accessed in the application. Preloading of some resources has been implemented, and there is a dedicated link tag designed to be modified to load the styles for each different page of the application.

CSS:

Adoption of CSS variables for colors, following a standardized nomenclature akin to Tailwind CSS. Implementation of the clamp function in the :root pseudo-class to ensure application responsiveness. Additionally, there was a separation of the globally utilized CSS from the styles that will be used for specific elements or pages.

JavaScript:

Practice frontend event handling with JS. Develop and manipulate application logic through routes, as well as managing styles and the functionality of elements. Utilization of OOP in JS. Importing and manipulating the contents of the pages that will be inserted into the element with the id "app" with the help of the file named router.js. Modular organization of the application, dividing it into blocks with distinct responsibilities. While the application may not demand extensive modularization, this structuring allows showcasing each JS file's competencies and practicing a directory structure resembling that of a more complex application, albeit on a smaller scale.
