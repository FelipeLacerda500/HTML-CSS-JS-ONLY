This small web application serves as a learning and practice ground for honing HTML and CSS skills. The primary focus of each technology in this project is outlined below:

HTML:

Emphasis on accessibility tools, utilizing aria-label attributes on selected elements. Implementation of the sr-only class on spans to insert custom texts exclusively read by screen readers.

CSS:

Usage of control CSS classes, exemplified by the sr-only class. Adoption of CSS variables for colors, following a standardized nomenclature akin to Tailwind CSS. Implementation of the clamp function in the :root pseudo-class to ensure application responsiveness.
